# EPCAPE-PIERS-EDGE

This repository provides resources for analyzing data collected from the EPCAPE pier node using the Waggle platform.  The EPCAPE-PIERSEDGE project, part of the larger EPCAPE campaign, deployed a Waggle edge computing device and a Mobotix thermal camera at the Scripps pier to study cloud and aerosol properties.  This repository includes example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data processing, analysis, and visualization techniques, along with sample data and documentation.  The project aims to utilize edge computing and AI to analyze data in near-real time, exploring applications like cloud motion and biodiversity monitoring.
(I will add example notebooks, sample data, and documentation to guide you through the download and analysis process.)

## Edge at the Pier: EPCAPE Software Defined Sensing

*   1 May 2023 - 29 February 2024
*   Lead Scientist: Scott Collis

A software-defined sensor makes use of algorithms inferring information near the source of the signal. This is known as edge computing. This field campaign will deploy a Sage Waggle edge computer device and a Mobotix steerable thermal camera to the Scripps pier. Use of AI at the edge will also be explored for applications like biodiversity through avian and other species detection. All code is open source and data will be available in near-real time.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.x:** Recommended version is 3.7 or higher.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For running the example notebooks.
*   **Required Python Packages:** Install these using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib xarray
    ```
*  **Sage_Data_Client** `pip3 install sage-data-client` Instructions for Waggle Apps adn can be found in [this](https://sagecontinuum.org/docs/reference-guides/dev-quick-reference) documentation.
